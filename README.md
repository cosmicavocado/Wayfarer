# Wayfarer

#### Created in collaboration by Mariah Legg & Eric Brown

This project is a mock site created to further explore and develop our new Angular skills. Given a set of vague user stories and a wireframe, we created a quick prototype product to showcase our ability to deliver for the customer.

## Approach

We took a hands on approach to fully planning and fleshing out all ambiguity before producing any code. We used the wireframe and user stories to determine what components would exist within the application and planned how they would interact with each other.

## Experience

This was more difficult than anticipated but we met the challenge head on and produced a working prototype that we are proud of.

**Elevator Pitch:**

Do you want an end product that uses the same tired templates? Or do you want a one-of-a-kind application centered on human connections where your travel community can thrive? Personally, we think you fall in the latter camp!

- Used agile methodologies to quickly produce a working prototype in order to get your feedback for our next iteration.
    - Note: not a final version.
- The side menu in our eyes was an excellent, unifying feature and so we incorporated it into the home page directly.
    - This ensures the user can easily and speedily interact with the content on your site.
- We integrated ng-bootstrap to produce a clean carousel to highlight some of your favorite locations.
- This prototype can easily be adjusted to meet your needs and we are dedicated to delivering results on your behalf.
